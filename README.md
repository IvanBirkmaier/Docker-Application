# WebApp CI/CD Deployment

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of a module in my Bachelor's degree program. The main task was to create a complete CI/CD pipeline for a small web application and deploy this application on AWS.

In addition to setting up the CI/CD pipeline, we also deployed K3D as a lightweight Kubernetes solution locally and delved deeper into Kubernetes as a topic. This allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of containerized applications and their orchestration.
